# Create Shortcut Story

A GitHub Action that will create a story directly in Shortcut (formerly Clubhouse) when needed. 

## About

We wanted to add drift detection into our Terraform process, but there wasn't a clean way to alert/add stories when drift is detected. Instead of adding a GitHub Issue and then posting it into Shortcut, the idea is to go straight to what is _our_ source of truth.
